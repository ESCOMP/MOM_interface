"unit tests" configuration
==========================

- This is not an oceanographic configuration.
  Instead it is the most minimal configuration that will allow the MOM6 code to run  in order to exercise unit tests.
- The ocean.stats files generated in this test are somewhat useless except that if they are not written at all then the model likely failed to pass a unit test.
